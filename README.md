 # In-Class Challenge and Walkthrough: Introduction to Cybersecurity

## Phase 1: Hands-on Walkthrough – Identifying Assets and Threats

### **Objective:**
Students will learn how to identify assets within an organization and understand the potential threats to these assets. They will practice identifying these elements in a real-world scenario.

### **Walkthrough Steps:**

1. **Introduction to Assets & Threats**
   - **Assets**: Anything of value to the organization, such as databases, websites, intellectual property, physical devices, etc.
   - **Threats**: Potential dangers that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of assets. Examples include cyber attacks, natural disasters, human error, or theft.

2. **Scenario Setup**
   - Present the students with a fictional organization:  
     _"Nexus Corp is a cutting-edge tech conglomerate operating internationally. Specializing in AI-driven financial services, digital identity management, and blockchain-secured data storage, they cater to high-profile clients across government and corporate sectors. Their infrastructure includes a state-of-the-art AI research facility, customer-facing financial platforms, proprietary blockchain nodes for secure transactions, and a global data center network. They have an internal server for website hosting, a payment gateway integration, customer databases, and employee devices connected to the network."_

3. **Identifying Critical Assets**
   - Ask students to list the critical assets for this company, for example:
     - Web Server (public-facing)
     - Multiple Database (stores sensitive customer data and internal data)
     - Payment Gateway (transaction processing)
     - Employee Devices (access to internal systems)
     - AI Research Facility (proprietary AI algorithms and research data)
     - Financial Services Platform (customer-facing web application)
     - Global Data Centers (storage and processing of client data)
     - Employee Workstations (access to internal systems and sensitive information)

4. **Identifying Potential Threats**
   - Introduce various types of threats and ask students to discuss how they might apply to each asset. For example:
     - **Web Server**: DDoS attack, SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
     - **Database**: Data breach, SQL injection, unauthorized access
     - **Payment Gateway**: Man-in-the-middle attack, phishing attacks, fraud
     - **Employee Devices**: Malware, social engineering, insider threats

5. **Mapping Assets to Threats**
   - Have the students create a table or diagram mapping each identified asset to the corresponding threats. For example:

   | **Asset**              | **Potential Threats**                                |
   |------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
   | Web Server             | DDoS, SQL Injection, XSS                             |
   | Database               | Data Breach, SQL Injection, Unauthorized Access     |
   | Payment Gateway        | Man-in-the-Middle, Phishing, Fraud                   |
   | Employee Devices       | Malware, Social Engineering, Insider Threats         |
   | AI Research Facility        | Intellectual Property Theft, Insider Threats, Cyber Espionage   |
   | Financial Services Platform | DDoS, SQL Injection, Phishing                                   |
   | Blockchain Network          | 51% Attack, Unauthorized Access, Smart Contract Vulnerabilities |
   | Global Data Centers         | Data Breaches, Physical Sabotage, Malware                       |
   | Employee Workstations       | Malware, Social Engineering, Credential Theft                   |

## Phase 2: Challenge – Mapping Critical Assets and Threats

### **Objective:**
Students will apply what they've learned by mapping critical assets and threats to a new fictional organization.

### **Challenge Steps:**

1. **Scenario**
   - Provide the students with a new fictional organization description:  
     _"TechCorp is a software development company that builds custom software solutions for clients. They store proprietary software code, customer contracts, and sensitive internal documents. They also have a cloud-based platform for collaboration and file sharing."_

2. **Task**
   - Students are tasked with identifying the critical assets for TechCorp and mapping them to potential threats. They must list at least five assets and match them with at least three potential threats for each asset.

3. **Guidelines**
   - The students should think about internal and external threats. Consider factors like:
     - Sensitive information (e.g., proprietary code, client contracts)
     - Physical and digital infrastructure (e.g., servers, cloud platforms)
     - Employees and access controls (e.g., laptops, VPNs, cloud storage)
   
4. **Deliverable**
   - A list of critical assets with corresponding threats, either in a table format or as a diagram.

5. **Debriefing**
   - After the challenge, go over the students’ answers and discuss common threats and best practices for mitigating these threats. Highlight any unique threats students may have identified and discuss them in the context of the organization's industry.

## Wrap-Up
- End the session with a brief Q&A or a discussion of the importance of asset identification in the context of risk management and cybersecurity.
